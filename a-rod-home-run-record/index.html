<p>The Yankees slugger turned 35 last Tuesday putting his home run pace far ahead of the rest. A-Rod hasnt hit 37 home runs in a season since 2007 so its likely Rodriguez will need more than two seasons to break Bonds record. BRONX NEW YORK MAY 8- The 661st career home run that Alex Rodriguez hit to the left-center field Thursday night at Yankee Stadium surpassing Willie Mays for sole possession of fourth place on baseballs all-time list may mean something for the record booksIt does not mean that Yankees management will budge and give A-Rod the millions that were a part of his lucrative contract. Another controversial figure on this list A-Rod enjoyed an incredible mid-career run in which he averaged 46 home runs during a nine-year period from 1999-2007. Bonds 756th home run ball which broke Hank Aarons career home run record was bought by fashion designer Marc Ecko for 752467.</p>
