<p>The vast majority of above ground swimming pools are built directly on the ground. Above ground pools are very similar to semi inground pools except for the fact that the entire depth of the pool is above ground and there are walls on all sides. The amount of sand required will naturally depend on the size of your above-ground swimming pool. Trust All Swim with all your swimming pool needs.
