<p>We have been working in the domain of socially assistive robotics the design and evaluation of robots meant to help people through social interaction for over a decade. Activities of daily living include. Walabot HOME uses radio frequency to tell if someone in the room has fallen. For example intelligent care aids such as robotic technologies extended care trolleys and lifters make life easier for nursing home and hospital staff. Robots have the potential to support older adults at home as they age in place as well as if they live in assisted living or skilled nursing residences.</p>
