<p>Please note an above ground swimming pool is not likely to add any value to your home. With inground pools whenever you are building a swimming pool out of concrete and into the ground the longevity of the structure is greater. Inground pool installation is far more expensive than that of an above ground pool. For instance you might achieve above ground pool installation in one day while inground pool installation could take 6 to 8 weeks.

These above ground swimming pools are usually round or oval and theres not much variety in the shape. Bring in the Spring with your own pool - Request a free catalogue.
