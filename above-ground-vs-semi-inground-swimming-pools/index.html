<p>One of the many benefits of owning a Semi-inground pool is the more appealing low profile look compared to a pool being installed completely above ground. Smaller pools mean less area to scrub and vacuum as well as less water volume to keep clean and chemically balanced. Although you can use a wraparound deck or creative landscape design to help an above-ground pool look its best this cant compare with the appearance of an inground pool. Typically an above ground pool install is done so in the flattest area possible to minimize digging and prep time.
