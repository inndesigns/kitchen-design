<p>HT Design platform bases are built with solid maple hardwood and are available in Black or Cherry. The new riser will be built as a box frame using 2x12 lumber with joists 16 OC. Riser is fully adjustable in width with only 3 skews. The dimensions of the riser need to be about 85 ft wide so people have an aisle to walk past it and about 6 feet long to accommodate the reclinable theater seats that will be on top of it. 2nd Row Seat Riser Photos Please Home Theater Home Theater Rooms Theatre Room Seating.</p>

Each of the 2 x 8s form quasi internal bulkheads partitioning the internal volume of the riser into individual semi sealed chambers. This detail shows a simple way to create a 105 raised platform with a 5 step.
